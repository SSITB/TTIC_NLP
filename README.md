[TTIC 31190 Introduction to Natural Language Processing (Spring 2018)](http://ttic.uchicago.edu/~kgimpel/teaching/31190-s18/index.html)

This repository contains my homework submissions to the problem sets for the Natural Language Processing class I took at TTIC while a Graduate Student at the University of Chicago.

[Prof. Kevin Gimpel](http://ttic.uchicago.edu/~kgimpel/index.html) taught the class.

This repository serves as as a contribution to my portfolio in the realm of Machine Learning.
