    " \n",
    "Hinge loss performs best on the bigram data, however, it does **not** outperform unigram accuracy on either DEV or DEV test.\n",
    "\n",
    "Having inspected the feature weights, we can see that lots of the highest weighted bigrams contain \"stop words\" and \"punctuation\". Perhaps if we pruned the feature template space to exclude combinations containing \"stop words\" or punctuation, we would get a better score.\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE:** I do not have enough time to create another feature template experiment or to test out my pruning theory as im currently in the midst of job interviews and preparing for graduation. I'm very sorry that I am not able to fully complete this section - my time is spit between interview prep and completing other assignments. Cheers!"
