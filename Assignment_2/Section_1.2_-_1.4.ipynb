    "    - Model Classification: 2\n",
    "    - Gold Standard: 1\n",

    "\n",
    "- Sentence: 'While the Resident Evil games may have set new standards for thrills , suspense , and gore for video games , the movie really only succeeds in the ''third of these.'\n",
    "    - Model Classification: 2\n",
    "    - Gold Standard: 0\n",
    "    - Reason: Very complex sentence, use of the word \"succeeds\" to give negative sentiment.\n",

    "\n",
    "- Sentence: \"It 's the perfect kind of film to see when you do n't want to use your brain.\"\n",
    "    - Model Classification: 0\n",
    "    - Gold Standard: 1\n",
    "    - Reason: The sentence is very neutral in that you cannot infer if the reviewer meant \"dont use your brain\" as either relaxing or horrendous. In this case, use of the word \"perfect\" is to describe a balance between sentiments, rather than a strictly positive sentiment. This is a difficult case. \"do n't\" is present in either class 0 or class 2, never in class 1."
